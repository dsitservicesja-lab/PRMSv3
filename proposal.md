## SECTION 5: APPROVAL CHAIN IMPLEMENTATION & VERIFICATION

### 5.1 Overview

Critical approval workflow verification ensured that procurement requests are routed to the correct approvers based on request amount and organizational branch.

### 5.2 Approval Chain Requirements

**Core Requirement:**
> "Procurement requests under thresholds are ONLY needed to be approved by branch supervisors. HOD is fallback and should not be required unless over threshold."

### 5.3 Approval Routing Matrix

#### Under Threshold (≤500K) - By Branch
| Branch | Approver | Requirement |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **HRM&A** | Director HRM&A | Branch supervisor only |
| **Analytical & Advisory** | Deputy Government Chemist | Branch supervisor only |
| **Other Branches** | HOD | Primary approver |

#### Over Threshold (>500K) - All Branches
| Threshold | Approver |
|-----------|----------|
| **>500K** | HOD | Required |

#### Special Cases
| Type | Approver |
|------|----------|
| **Petty Cash** | HOD | Primary approver |
| **Reimbursement** | Branch Head → Procurement → Finance | Multi-step workflow |

### 5.4 Issues Identified & Fixed

#### ✅ Bug Fix 1: Permission Escalation
**Problem:** HOD could approve under-threshold HRM&A and Analytical requests
**Root Cause:** Over-permissive fallback logic
**Status:** FIXED

**Files Modified:** `config/workflow.php`
```php
// BEFORE (buggy):
if ($estimatedValue <= 500000 && $primaryRole !== 'HOD') {
    $approvers[] = 'HOD';  // ← WRONG
}

// AFTER (fixed):
return [$primaryRole];  // ← Only primary approver
```

#### ✅ Bug Fix 2: Strict Role Matching
**Function:** `canApproveStage()`
**Update:** Now requires exact role match, no fallback exceptions
**Status:** FIXED

### 5.5 Verification Checklist

- ✅ HRM&A Under-500K: Director HRM&A only
- ✅ Analytical Under-500K: Deputy GC only
- ✅ Other Branches Under-500K: HOD only
- ✅ All Branches Over-500K: HOD required
- ✅ Petty Cash All Branches: HOD required
- ✅ Reimbursement: Multi-step chain enforced

Automated email notifications alert approvers when procurement requests need action, with proper routing based on organizational structure and request amount.

### 6.2 Features Implemented

#### ✅ Feature 1: Approver Detection
- **Function:** `getApproverEmailForBranch()`
- **Logic:** Uses branch-based approval rules from workflow.php
- **Accuracy:** Correctly identifies approver based on branch and amount

#### ✅ Feature 2: Branch-Based Supervisor Assignment
| Branch | ≤500K Approver | >500K Approver |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| HRM&A | Director HRM&A | HOD |
| Analytical & Advisory | Deputy Government Chemist | HOD |
| Other Branches | HOD | HOD |

#### ✅ Feature 3: Notification Triggers
- **Trigger:** Request submission
- **Recipient:** First approver (determined by branch rules)
- **Action:** Review & Approve Request
- **Subject:** "New Procurement Request Pending Approval"

### 6.3 Code Implementation

**Files Modified:**
1. **config/notifications.php**
   - Added `getApproverEmailForBranch()`
   - Fixed `getBranchHeadEmail()` query
   - Updated `notifyRequestSubmitted()`

2. **procurement/submit.php**
   - Calls notification functions on submission
   - Retrieves correct approver ID

### 6.4 Configuration

**Email Service:** PHPMailer  
**Configuration File:** `config/app.php`
```php
define('MAIL_HOST', 'smtp.gmail.com');
define('MAIL_PORT', 587);
define('MAIL_USER', 'your-email@gmail.com');
define('MAIL_PASS', 'your-app-password');
